# Word-Name-Generator
Generates readable(term used lightly, WIP) words or names based on input(length) * how many to generate.

##Aim
The aim of this code is to output names or words that are as readable(English) as possible.
It was designed to assist with making aliases or usernames in mind. Being that you can generate a list of names 
and pick the best/your favourite one. This can be hard for some people especially those lacking creative thinking 
or wanting "truly" random yet readable usernames.
Most name and word generators either ouput unreadable text or names that are made from prefix/suffix lists. 
This code however does it's best to be random yet readable.

##Issues
Not all output is "desirable". For instance words like nslyupo & ckakrka while yet readable aren't the greatest names.

##Solutions
- Periodically letter selection will be adjusted to make better words & names.
- Forks are encouraged and will be recognized in contributors.
- Suggetions will be taken into consideration and applied as deemed necessary. Also mentioned in Contributors.
